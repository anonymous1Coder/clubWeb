    "base_rule": "The Knights and Knaves puzzle is set on a fictional island or environment inhabited by two types of characters: Knights, who always tell the truth, and Knaves, who always lie. Players must analyze the statements made by these characters to determine their true identities.\n\nBasic rules:\n1. Fixed identity traits: All statements made by a Knight are true; all statements made by a Knave are false.\n2. Mutual awareness: Characters fully know whether others are Knights or Knaves.\n3. Semantic convention: Each statement can be directly interpreted as a logical proposition—truthful statements have a truth value of true, and lies have a truth value of false.\n\nKnown conditions:\n1. List of participants: Several characters (e.g., A, B, C...) are involved.\n2. Statement set: Each character makes one or more statements about themselves or others.\n3. Initial state: Identities are unknown (Knight or Knave), but each character knows the others’ identities. No statements violate the basic rules (e.g., no internal contradiction).\n\nFinal objective:\nBy applying logical reasoning, determine whether each character is a Knight or a Knave, and identify the truth value of each statement. The ideal solution should be unique, leading to no ambiguity or logical contradictions.",
