    "base_rule": "Sudoku is a classic number puzzle based on permutation and logical reasoning. A standard Sudoku board is a 9×9 square grid, consisting of 81 cells divided into nine 3×3 subgrids (blocks). \n The filling rules are as follows, all of which must be satisfied simultaneously: 1. Row constraint: Each of the 9 rows must contain the digits 1 to 9 exactly once, with no repetitions. 2. Column constraint: Each of the 9 columns must contain the digits 1 to 9 exactly once, with no repetitions. 3. Block constraint: Each of the nine 3×3 subgrids must also contain the digits 1 to 9 exactly once, with no repetitions. \n Known conditions: The initial puzzle provides several pre-filled digits as clues; the remaining cells are blank and denoted by zeros ('0'). All given digits must satisfy the above constraints (i.e., the initial state is valid). \n Solving objective: Based on the given clues, infer and fill in all remaining cells such that the entire board satisfies all three constraints. Each valid puzzle should have a unique solution, with no multiple valid completions.",
