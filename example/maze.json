    "base_rule": "A maze is a two-dimensional grid pathfinding problem, where the core objective is to find a feasible path from the start point to the end point — preferably the shortest one.\n\nBasic rules:\n1. Cell states: The grid consists of characters, where 'O' indicates a walkable cell and 'X' indicates an obstacle that cannot be entered.\n2. Coordinate system: Positions are represented as $(x, y)$, where $x$ is the column index (from left to right, starting at 0), and $y$ is the row index (from top to bottom, starting at 0).\n3. Movement rules: From any 'O' cell, movement is only allowed in four directions — up, down, left, and right — with each move having a step size of 1.\n4. Path constraint: The path must consist only of moves between 'O' cells; crossing over 'X' cells is not allowed.\n\nKnown conditions:\n1. A character grid of size $rows \\times cols$, where each cell is either 'O' or 'X'.\n2. Start coordinate $(begin_x, begin_y)$ and end coordinate $(end_x, end_y)$.\n3. The start and end positions are guaranteed to be on 'O' cells.\n4. There may exist multiple valid paths, or possibly none.\n\nFinal objective:\nFind the shortest path from the start to the end position (i.e., the path with the minimum number of steps). Output the list of coordinates $(x, y)$ in path order. If no valid path exists, report that no solution can be found.",
